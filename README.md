Hidden semi-Markov model code based on Langrock et al. 2012

Code based on Langrock et al. 2012 in Ecology (http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/11-2241.1). Made to fit hidden semi-Markov model to movement data. Here we are interested in fitting the models to multiple individuals at once and have models where parameters differ across different groups of individuals.
